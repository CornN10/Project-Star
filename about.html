				<h1>About us</h1>
				<h2>Join us to support our cause!</h2>
				<h2>
					We are a student club based in Bangkok, Thailand, and part of the Bangkok Patana school community. We aspire
					to help improve the lives of children with disabilities all over Thailand and raise awareness for this crucial
					cause, where we have recently established a partnership with the 'Thai Child development foundation', which is
					an inspiring organization that specializes in helping underprivileged children through educational and medical
					programs on a local and national scale. Our motto is “Everyone has a chance to shine” since we believe that
					everyone has their own unique potential, strengths, and is deserving of equal access to opportunities. Join
					our family and help showcase the incredible abilities of those with disabilities!
